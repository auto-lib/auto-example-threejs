# auto example threejs

here we see threejs being used with auto.

## running

make sure you have `vite` installed (`npm install -g vite`)
and then simply

```bash
$ vite
```

from the project dir. it should open a server.

## reloading

what's great about `vite` is any changes to the source
(either `index.html` or the code in `main.js`, which
isn't being used currently) will update the browser
automatically - instant feedback.
